Create a fullstack web application project named "Vaulted Assets".

**Frontend Stack**:
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Dark/Light mode toggle (globally updates theme using Tailwind and context)

**Backend Stack**:
- Create a placeholder folder structure for backend logic using Express + TypeScript (or leave as stub)
- No need to implement any backend logic or database integration at this stage

**User Roles**:
- Retail Investor
- Institutional Investor

**Current Focus**:
- Implement a modern, responsive UI prototype based on detailed user stories
- Do not include actual data fetching, API logic, or backend validation
- Build the following **UI screens** only:
  - Landing Page (user selects Retail or Institutional)
  - Role-based Onboarding (Sign Up) pages
  - Login Page
  - Dashboard (stubbed for both Retail and Institutional users)
  - Theme Toggle (Dark/Light) available globally

**Design References**:
- https://www.paxos.com/pax-gold
- https://app.tether.to/app/login

**UI/UX Requirements**:
- Use a centralized layout system (components + pages folder in `src`)
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Accessible dark/light theme toggle using Context API or Zustand
- Buttons and UI elements must be styled to reflect a modern financial application (rounded edges, hover states, form validations)
- Use dummy media/images where necessary

**Theme Toggle Details**:
- Use Tailwind's `darkMode: 'class'` configuration
- Implement a global toggle (e.g. in Navbar or Header)
- Store theme preference in localStorage and apply it on load
- Example tailwind utility classes: `bg-white dark:bg-gray-900`, `text-black dark:text-white`, etc.

**Use placeholders or dummy handlers for routing**:
- All navigation should use React Router
- Pages must be visually functional but do not require backend integration
